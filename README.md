Design of a General Purpose Microprocessor


Full custom design. 
General purpose Multi-Cycle Microprocessor. 
Consist of SRAM, ALU and Register Files. 
Support 13 different instructions including: 
  memory instructions like LOAD STORE, 
  logic instructions like AND OR XOR, ADD instructions with 3 different burst lengths
  16-bit division instruction.  
Optimized in terms of area, delay and power consumption.  
Perl script used as decode stage of the processor(decoding instructions by generating input control signals)
Result verification by perl script.
