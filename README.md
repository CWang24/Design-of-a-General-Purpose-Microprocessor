===================================
####Features
Full custom design.&nbsp;<br />
General purpose Multi-Cycle Microprocessor.&nbsp;<br />
Consist of SRAM, ALU and Register Files.&nbsp;<br />
Support 13 different instructions including:&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;memory instructions like LOAD STORE,&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;logic instructions like AND OR XOR, ADD instructions with 3 different burst lengths<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 16-bit division instruction. &nbsp;<br />
Optimized in terms of area, delay and power consumption. &nbsp;<br />
Perl script used as decode stage of the processor(decoding instructions by generating input control signals)<br />
Result verification by perl script.<br />
